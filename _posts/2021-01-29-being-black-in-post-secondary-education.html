<p>Being black in university can be really tough, especially in fields where there are particularly few BIPOC. I studied computer science at the U of M and I was almost always the only black person in my class, or at best, one of 2-3. That may not seem like a big deal, but it takes a huge toll. Like we all should know by now, black people are systematically oppressed in America, and I was no exception to that. Throughout college, I ran into a lot of financial struggles, and sometimes found myself in real danger of not being able to pay my rent or buy groceries. I also had to work and hustle in order to keep me and my family afloat. Naturally, it isn't very easy to focus on school, or perform to the highest degree when your vital needs are at risk. Worst of all, because of the lack of diversity in higher education, I didn't feel like I had anyone to reach out to, or that there was anyone who fully understood what I was going through. I was surrounded by priviledged white people while fighting to make my way through a system that frankly, I didn't feel was made for me. I guess you could say the lack of diversity made me feel like I had to suffer in silence, but if you're dealing with this, I want you to know that you are not alone, and that you are indeed meant to be there. It is 100% not your fault and the blame falls entirely on America/society.</p>
